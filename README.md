# Agile Group Project 

This is a prgram that allows users write comments and edit them. 
Users are in 3 categories ie. normal users, moderators, admins

# Users: 
Normal users can only create new comments, and edit the their own comments. 
Moderators have the added ability to delete comments (to remove trolls) 
Admins have the ability to edit or delete any comment. 

Users can log in and out, and we track when they last logged in
